# Random username generator in Flutter

An infinite scrolling list of random usernames. As you scroll along, it generates new random
usernames using the english language.

When you can't decide what username to use, this may provide inspiration.

## Demo

The code is located in the ``lib`` directory.

Future tasks:
- Add support for other languages (i.e., 'labaguette')
- Add numbers to usernames (but, this time, there's a good chance the username is available without having to add numbers)
